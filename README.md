The best way to run tests is to make it from a command line.


In command line go to the folder BYT3 and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Also You can run it from your IDE, for example in JetBrains Rider you just have to start tests from the tests files.

Also You may see the initial commit made from non-university account, I appologize for that, this is my personal one.
